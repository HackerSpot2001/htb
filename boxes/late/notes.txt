scan shows ssh and webapp

go to webapp late.htb
static page with link to images.late.htb

i.l.h converts images to text
upload image, get results.txt
the image is scanned and any text on it is returned in
  a textfile.

Open burp, all I see is a POST of the JPG.

upload php shell with fake extension, get error:
  Error occured while processing the image: cannot identify image file '/home/svc_acc/app/uploads/zaco.jpg8498'

try double extension, get same error
you can't do XSS with SVG files, invalid extension

it's an SSTI. The webpage is running Flask with Jinja2.
Sending an image of {{7*'7'}} gives you 77777 so 
we have poc that it's vulnerable.

{{ get_flashed_messages.globals.builtins.open("/etc/passwd").read() }} 

^This should give us a copt of the passwd file.
