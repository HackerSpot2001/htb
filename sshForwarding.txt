When you want to forward a port on a machine and you have 
SSH you run the following:

1.) Pass ~C to place yourself in ssh command mode
    |> This will drop you out of your current shell
2.) Pass -L LPORT:IP.ADD.RES.S##:HPORT

This will send a connection from the Listener Port (LPORT)
through the IP ADDRESS on the Host Port (HPORT)

That's all there is to it. If you reach out through the 
LPORT, you will get a response as if you were the IP:PORT
you specified. This can be run with Loopback address to make
a box think you are on localhost making requests on the box.
If you do this, requesting your loopback address will 
actually display the content being passed through the SSH
tunnel as if you were on the localhost of the machine you
have tunneled.
